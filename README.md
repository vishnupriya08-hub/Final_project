**Emotion Detection from Uploaded Images**
**Project Title:**
Emotion Detection from Uploaded Images

**Objective:**
Develop a comprehensive system enabling users to upload an image through a Streamlit application and accurately detect and classify the emotion present in the image using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This project involves developing, designing, implementing, and optimizing a complete solution integrating machine learning, computer vision, and user interface design.

**Project Scope:**
**End-to-End Development:**
Responsible for all aspects of the project, from setting up the image upload interface to training the CNN model and delivering a polished, user-friendly application.

**Real-World Relevance:**
The project should address potential applications in areas such as healthcare, education, and customer service, where emotion detection is valuable.

**Key Components:**

**1. User Interface Development:**
Design a Streamlit application that allows users to easily upload images.
Ensure the application only accepts image files (check format and size).
Focus on creating an intuitive, responsive interface with clear instructions for the user.

**2. Facial Detection Implementation:**
Implement facial detection in the uploaded images using pre-trained models and custom models.
Resize the image to the required dimensions.
Explore options to enhance detection accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, such as refining detection thresholds or combining methods.

**3. Facial Feature Extraction:**
Use tools like Dlib or Mediapipe to extract key facial landmarks.
Analyze how the accuracy of landmark detection impacts the emotion classification process.

**4. Emotion Classification:**
Train and fine-tune a CNN model using datasets such as FER-2013 available on Kaggle.
Experiment with different CNN architectures and training techniques to maximize the model’s accuracy.

**5. Performance and Optimization:**
Evaluate the model’s performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Implement optimizations to ensure the system runs efficiently and delivers results in real-time.

**Expected Results:**
A fully functional application where users can upload images and receive accurate emotion classifications.
A detailed report covering the system’s design, implementation, performance analysis, and potential applications.
An exploration of the ethical considerations related to emotion detection, including privacy concerns and bias mitigation.
